# Simple examples

The codes here are from [evidential-learning-pytorch](https://github.com/teddykoker/evidential-learning-pytorch/tree/main), which I heavily used as my reference to understand the concept of evidential deep learning.

`cubic.py` contains code for "Evidential Deep Regression", which is EDL adapted for regression task.
